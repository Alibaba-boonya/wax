Setup
-----

I'm assuming you've got oink... if not, grab it at http://github.com/probablycorey/oink

• Create a new "Window-based Application" iPhone project in xcode

• Drag the oink folder into the your app's root folder (via Finder/Terminal not xCode). Then drag the oink/src folder into the xcode "Groups & Files" pane. You want to make sure "Copy items into destination group's folder" is NOT checked and "Recursively create groups for any added folders" is selected. 

• In your UIApplication delegate file add...
    #import "oink.h"

• In your UIApplication delegate's "applicationDidFinishLaunching:" method (after the call to [window makeKeyAndVisible]) add...
  oink_start();
  // OR if you want to add extensions
  // oink_startWithExtensions(luaopen_libXfunction, luaopen_libYfunction, nil);
    
• Add a run script build phase (This will copy all your lua scripts into the app bundle every time you build the project.)
1.) In the xcode Groups & Files pane right click "Targets"
2.) Click Add > New Build Phase > New Run Script Build Phase
3.) A weird little editor window should pop up. In the Script text area write 
  oink/copy_scripts.sh
  
• Now build your app! It should compile and you should have a new folder named "data" (The data folder won't show up in xcode unless you add it to the project... that is optional though)

• When you run the app, it will run the lua script located at /data/scripts/init.lua Put your magic in there

Trouble shooting
----------------
*bad argument #1 to '???' (oink.instance expected, got ???)
Usually means you called a function with a '.' instead of a ':'
