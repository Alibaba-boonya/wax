I'm assuming you've got oink... if not, grab it at http://github.com/probablycorey/oink

Create a new iphone xcode project

From the Finder, drag the oink folder into the app's root folder apps located in the xcode Groups & Files pane. Make sure "Copy items into destination group's folder" is checked and "Recursively create groups for any added folders" is selected

In your UIApplication delegate file add...
    #import "oink.h"

In your UIApplication delegate's "applicationDidFinishLaunching:" method (and after [window makeKeyAndVisible])
  oink_start()
  // OR if you want to add extensions
  oink_startWithExtensions(luaopen_libXfunction, luaopen_libYfunction, nil);
    
Add a run script build phase (This will copy all your lua scripts into the app bundle.)
1.) In the xcode Groups & Files pane right click "Targets"
2.) Click Add > New Build Phase > New Run Script Build Phase
3.) A weird little window should pop up. In the Script text area write 

  oink/copy_scripts.sh
  
Now build your app! It should work and you should have a new folder called "Data" (The data folder won't show up in xcode unless you add it to the project... that is optional though)

When you run the app, it will start in the /Data/Scripts/init.lua file... Put your magic in there

Trouble shooting

*bad argument #1 to '???' (oink.instance expected, got ???)
Usually means you called a function with a '.' instead of a ':'
